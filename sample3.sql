--  ---------------------------views & indexes----------------------------------

/* A better way to do this is to save the query in the database server and assign a name to it. 
This named query is called a database view, or simply, view. 

Note that a view does not physically store the data.
 When you issue the SELECT statement against the view,
 MySQL executes the underlying query specified in the viewâ€™s definition and returns the result set.
 For this reason, sometimes, a view is referred to as a virtual table.

Advantages of MySQL Views,
1. simplify complex query
2. make the business logic consistent
3. Add extra security layers
4. Enable backward compatibility

 Without an index, MySQL must scan the whole table to locate the relevant rows. 
The larger table, the slower it searches. */
